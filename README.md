# My CV built using RMarkdown

This is the repo to build my CV using RMarkdown and the [`{pagedown}`](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown) package. 
All of this is heavily building on [Nick Strayer's CV](https://github.com/nstrayer/cv) and his [`{datadrivencv}`](http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/) package.
